The Council of Berlin is one of the three Tri-Annual in-person meetings of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, the other two are shoulder events to EthCC in Q1 and Devcon in Q4. While in-person meetings facilitate technical discussions, the Magicians intend for decisions to be finalized in the [online forums](https://ethereum-magicians.org) so that the broadest number of people can participate.

### About the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians:

* The Goal. To keep Ethereum The Best It Can Technically Be.
* The Mission. To Nurture Community Consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum.
* The Work. Primarily, high-quality Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), accepted by a consensus of the Community.

_Note: The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians is not currently a formal organization or corporation._
